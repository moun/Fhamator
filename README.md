A prototype implementation of a big-step While analyzer for secure information flow. 
It leverages an existing While analyzer supporting interval analysis to add a cardinality abstraction. 

This analyzer implements the analysis presented in this paper "The Cardinal Abstraction for Quantitative Information Flow" (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01334604) and this dissertation "https://hal.inria.fr/tel-01184857".

An improved abstract interpreter prototype accounting for recent versions of this work is upcoming.
